# Idea 1: Analyzing bubbles 
We can retrieve the set of all videos certain users have commented on, and in this way analyze the mean overlap of these sets for two users in a certain group. This could be interpreted as a measure for how isolated this group acts
 on Youtube, i.e., whether the group members communicate mainly within the group or not. The idea is similar to the concept often referred to as "filter bubbles". For instance, one could analyze all users that have commented on at least 10 videos from a specific
 channel, and see if these users seem to form an isolated "bubble" or not. For example, this could be done for one major left-wing channel and one major right-wing channel, to see whose commenters are more isolated; or for a fan channel of a major athlete and
 a fan channel of a major pop star. Similarly, one could analyze users that have commented on at least 10 videos with a certain keyword in the description, which could again be linked to politics, sports or entertainment. Another option is to compare the same
 group of videos over time: In this way, one could analyze for instance how isolated commenters of right-wing content were 2 years before and after Trump's election. 
# Idea 2: How to get loyal fans 
We can try to describe the structure and dynamics of YouTube channels using the distribution of their sizes (subscriber and view counts), the typical weekly views divided by the number of subscribers (a measure for "subscriber interest"), the relation between upload frequency and view/subscriber count, the relation
 between ads in the description and subscriber count, or the stability of channel rankings over time. By grouping the channels and videos into categories, we can compare the mentioned metrics between the different categories. E.g.: Which category of channels
 has the most loyal fans (many views per subscriber and stable rankings over time)? And how do their uploading habits (frequency, video length, content) differ from other categories? 
# Idea 3: Characterizing links in the description 
Video description may contain links connected to ad campaigns, links to a patreon account or links to a PayPal account, just to name a few. The dataset could be used to analyze what links are used, by whom, and in what context. For instance: Who puts a PayPal link in the description, i.e.,
 what is most frequently the content of such videos? A guess could be that these are independent political influencers/self-proclaimed journalists and similar. Similarly, which category of videos most frequently uses ads in the description? These analyses could
 be performed by comparing e.g. the set of all videos with ads to other, defined sets of videos, such as the set of videos related to music, based on different criteria (YouTube category, keywords in the description etc.). It could also be possible to further
 analyze the resulting sets in other regards, such as the mean subscriber count or weekly views of videos in the set.

# Assistant feedback
TA/SA:Shawn, Shuangqi/Matea \\ email: shuyang.fan@epfl.ch, shuangqi.li@epfl.ch\\ Feedback: Interesting ideas with great explanations, well done! I especially like the frst idea and how you define the bubbles and I think it could lead to some very interesting insights. Just as an advice - make the idea to be more specific. For example, you could define more clearly from which spheres do you want to find bubbles (as you mentioned politics, sports etc.) and what kind of analysis you want to do between them in order to tell an interesting story.
