# Ideas for the project

(based on ideas submitted by us in our google forms)

## Lou-Anne :

I like :

1. idea n3 of Hortense
2. Idea n2 of Mila

(between other thing, i like all your ideas ahah)
\--> i asked chatgpt to try to merge this two ideas as i thought they could be link and he gave me this :

### The Democratization of Technology and YouTube's Role in Learning During Global Events (2005-2019)

This project aims to explore how the democratization of technology, especially the rise of smartphones, expanded YouTube's community between 2005 and 2019, and how this expansion contributed to its evolution as a learning platform during major global events. By analyzing channel creation trends, content evolution, and viewership patterns, we aim to understand YouTubeâ€™s dual role as an entertainment and educational hub.

i like it, this could be an idea

I also really like the link idea of Andreas!

## Andreas:

I like:

1. idea n1 by me :) (Filter bubble analysis based on comments - maybe this could be done, but with the actual content inspired by one of the other ideas)
2. idea n3 by Hortense (Youtube over the years, older channels)
3. idea n2 by Mila (youtube as a source of learning)
4. idea n3 by Mila (Challenges on youtube - I could imagine a variant of this not only for challenges, but for other trends/events/whatever, something with a clear peak, and limited duration)
5. idea n2 by Lou-Anne (Election results vs Youtube data - Well, I like this in theory, but I think working with the topic of the am. elections would be exhausting..)
6. idea n3 by Lou-Anne (suggesting optimal creator behaviour for diff. categories etc.)
7. idea n3 by Manon (detecting algorithm changes - BUT I don't know how we would do it, really. IF we had some claim from the media saying "XY was changed in 2016" then maybe we could investigate if we see an effect)

So, proposed ideas:

### Communities over the years

A combination of my idea no1 (filter bubbles based on comments) and Hortenses idea no3 (YouTube over the years, older channels)

The idea is to check

* were filter bubbles stronger or weaker before? This could both be done looking at the same type of channels/topics etc over the years, to see if there is change, and/or looking at different types of content, reflecting change in the available content on youtube (what I mean is: it could be e.g. that political channel communities were as strongly a filter bubble earlier as they are today, but that there is much more political content on youtube now than earlier. So if we only compare political communities, we would miss this effect.

and/or

* were communities stronger/more closed/contained before than today? Its a similar thing as the above, but maybe for different topics: fans of a particular game or music etc. doesn't necessarily mean that its a typical "filter bubble", it could just be a strong community

This could all be a part of the analysis Hortense proposed, so like one of he aspects of older youtube we analyze.

Also, we can also look at the consistency of the viewers (or rather commenters) for long-lasting channels: for those old channels that still survived til today, we can check how many of the commenters are new and how many are old, for example.

### Can we see a (e.g.) meToo effect on youtube, and how did it look like?

Mostly based on Milas idea no2 and no3

I guess the feedback makes sense that its hard to see where an effect comes from because multiple events

Also, its hard to say "people are using it actively to learn", maybe it's just content that feels relevant , people talk about the topic, but its not necessarily learning/news/information?

From the challenges idea, I like the aspect of looking at the time aspect of trends

So one could look at major events (should probably really be major, so elections or meetoo is maybe better than MH370), and look at effects, and like  analyse that in the sense of a trend, line how fast does it come and go, where is the peak etc
