# The Democratization of Technology and YouTube's Role in Learning During Global Events (2005-2019)

This project aims to explore how the democratization of technology, especially the rise of smartphones, expanded YouTube's community between 2005 and 2019, and how this expansion contributed to its evolution as a learning platform during major global events. By analyzing channel creation trends, content evolution, and viewership patterns, we aim to understand YouTubeâ€™s dual role as an entertainment and educational hub.

i like it, this could be an idea

I also really like the link idea of Andreas!
