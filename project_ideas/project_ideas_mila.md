# 2 big ideas that we could simplify
## Famous youtubers and loyal fans 
Lams idea 3: Aalyzing patterns of famous youtubers
- videos/week
- video duration
- upload date
- keywords in title / description (clickbaits)

-> Instead of talking about 'success', which is given by many other factors (not realistic for our project), we could simplify this idea into 'influencers statistics'.

Andreas idea 2: loyal fans
- subscribers interest : views per week / nb subscribers
- upload freq / subscribers count or view
- stability of ranking over time
- ads / subscribers nb

-> nice ideas/stats to add to Lams#3

## Youtube evolution vs. society evolution
Horti idea 3 : How did YouTube grow over the years ? 
Project name is a bit broad/not specific enough but ideas inside are cool !!

- Date of creation of several channels could indicate the rate of growth of YouTube’s community.
- Compare the content proposed by the channels and how it changed throughout generations 
(X, Y, Z and Alpha) as viewers and content creators. 
- Activity of the subscribers, how much they comment and interact with each other. 
- How did the 2005 YouTube channels survived, if they did. As the first content on the platform born in 2005, were these 
YouTube channels still active in 2019, are they “famous” or just in the shadow of the new ones created day by day ?

# Easier / more straightforward project ideas (less chances to get lost in the datas and analysis)

Andreas idea 3: links
Practical question: I dont understand how we would find links traces from the dataset

Mila idea 3: Challenges idea
- challenges keywords to look for in the datasets
