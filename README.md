“Are You Stuck in a YouTube Bubble? It's Time to Expand Your Information Sources!”


Abstract
The common advice suggests that to stay well-informed, one should diversify its sources.  However, YouTube users often fall into clusters, groups formed by particularly active people within a channel. These clusters reflect communities invested into the same channel but don't yet imply that they don’t diversify their sources.
The problem arises when these clusters evolve into bubbles, where users become confined to content that aligns with their existing beliefs, limiting exposure to other points of view. In these bubbles, interaction is mostly with individuals who share the same belief, which can contribute to polarization and radicalization.
In this study, we aim to analyze how users in News and Politics content tend to restrict their interactions to specific channels (forming clusters) and whether these clusters lead to the creation of bubbles. We will first identify clusters based on commenting behavior and then assess how isolated these clusters are, focusing on whether they cross over into informational bubbles that reinforce one-sided perspectives.
